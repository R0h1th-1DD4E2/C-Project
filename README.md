# Op-Amp Calculator 

This is a command-line tool written in C programming language that can calculate output voltage and gain for different types of operational amplifier circuits. It can calculate output voltage and gain for:

1. Inverting Amplifier
2. Non-Inverting Amplifier
3. Integrating Amplifier
4. Differentiator Amplifier
5. Summing Amplifier
6. Subtractor Amplifier
7. Gain Calculator

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the cloned directory
3. Compile the source code with the following command:

```
gcc -o opampcalculator opampcalculator.c
```

4. Run the program with the following command:

```
./opampcalculator
```

## Usage

1. Choose the type of amplifier you want to calculate output voltage or gain for by typing in the corresponding number (1-7).
2. Follow the prompts to input the necessary values for the chosen amplifier.
3. The output voltage or gain will be displayed.
4. If you want to calculate output voltage or gain for another amplifier, choose "Y" when prompted to try again. Otherwise, choose "N" to exit the program.
